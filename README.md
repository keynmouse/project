1. conveyor system
###We have built a conveyor system that measures relative positions using a global camera, performs object detection with a robotâ€™s camera and YOLOv8, and is managed through a control room GUI
2. restaurant automation system
###We developed a restaurant automation system where the customer kiosk, serving robot, and kitchen display communicate with each other via ROS, and a database has also been established
3. Swarm robots for bomb disposal
###This project operates two robots (using custom zacro files) in a virtual simulation: one scan robot for mine detection and another robot for mine removal.
4.CAMAZON's Automated Logistics Truck System 
###In CAMAZON's Automated Logistics Truck System, the YOLOv8n model component was excluded due to its large size."
